    I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://math.utexas.edu/">Department of Mathematics</a> at the University of Texas at Austin. I am fortunate enough to be co-advised by Prof. <a href="https://math.utexas.edu/directory/stefania-patrizi">Stefania Patrizi</a> and Prof. <a href="https://math.utexas.edu/directory/rachel-ward">Rachel A. Ward</a>. I am broadly interested in nonlocal problems in analysis, deep learning methods in solving partial differential equations, and the mathematics of large language models. To see up to date published work/preprints or relavant code, here are my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LtO6zfcAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://github.com/erisahasani">GitHub</a> pages.

    Aside from academic training, I had the opportunity to gain some industry experience through two back-to-back internships at <a href="https://www.amd.com/en.html">Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)</a> on the HPC team. There, I worked on applications of automating the process of code translation from Fortran into HIP through fine-tuning LLMs and using agentic AI. For more details on my academic or industry experience, see my <a href="https://www.ehasani.com/cv/">CV</a>.

    <br> <br>
    I am on the job market starting summer of 2026.
