            Hello! My name is Erisa, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin. I am currently working with Prof. Rachel A. Ward and Prof. Stefania Patrizi. My research interests are both in applied problems and theoretical results on PDEs. I am interested in deep learning methods for numerical solutions to PDE problems and in theoretical results on non-local problems. For some more details, here's my <a href="https://www.ehasani.com/cv/">Curriculum Vitae</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LtO6zfcAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a> page. Outside of mathematics, I also enjoy visual arts.
