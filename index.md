&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello everyone! Welcome to my website! I do not have much up here yet, but I am working on it. Part of my 2023-year resolution is to keep up with content in here.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First, let me introduce myself. I am a second year PhD student in Mathematics at UT Austin. My research interests are both in theoretical and applied mathematics. I am interested in the theory of PDE and applications and numerical solvers, including machine learning techniques. The latter is new and rapidly growing, we are living through some exciting times! Outside of mathematics, I am also interestead in visual arts, in particular paintings.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I did my batchelor's and master's degrees at Florida Tech, in Melbourne, FL (2016-2021). Prior to that, I lived and went to school in Kalamata, Greece, for several years, and before that I lived in Elbasan, Albania where I was also born. I do have fond memories from all those places, and I am incredibly grateful that I ended up learning three languages.
